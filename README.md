# Hybrid-Storage-Sizing-methodology
Model to size a hybrid energy storage system based on recurring patterns analysis using DTW clustering and battery oprimization dispatch
This research focuses on the technology-independent sizing methodology of HESS as well as control storage and application and offers a comprehensive, fourfold contribution. Initially, by utilizing a time series, we analyze recurring patterns to identify the load profile. Subsequently, we delve into battery optimization scheduling by using a linear programming (LP) problem, determining the battery dispatch that will serve as input to the next phase. Then we describe and discuss the battery hybridization model, crafting a tool that delineates the hybridization area for the optimal HESS sizing model
